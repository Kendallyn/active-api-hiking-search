## Background

I wanted to create an app to easily see hiking events or trails. I've always enjoyed discovering new outdoor places that I can bring my camera along for some nature photography.

## Use Case

This app gives hikers and outdoor enthusiasts access to search for hiking events or trails within a 50 mile radius of the city they search for.

## Initial UX

The initial mobile and desktop wireframes can be seen below:

## Working Prototype

You can access a working prototype of the app here: https://active-api-hiking-search.herokuapp.com/

## Functionality

Included:
* Search for hikes within a 50 mile radius from a US city
* Return 24 results
* Results provide the hiking event, location, date, and a description (if provided from API)
* Save the hiking event to a pinned favorite section
* Delete hiking event from the pinned favorite section

## Technical

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* mLab
* Heroku
This app uses AJAX JSON calls to the *Active.com* API to return user search results. It has been designed to be responsive on desktop as well as mobile devices of all screen sizes.

## Development Roadmap

* To have the user be able to include a search radius with their location
* Have the search results have next and previous buttons to search multiple pages of hikes
* Add search to include kayaking and other outdoor adventures
